## Topic

This repository is simply me refreshing my basics of `Markdown`. Feel free to use it anytime you need a quick cheat sheet.

> `Markdown` is a lightweight markup language used for formating text. It was designed to be easy to write and easy to read.

## keywords & Notes

### Line breaks

To create a line break in an `.md` file, you will need to include one of the following:

* Include two spaces at the end of the first line.

    Example

    ```
    This is example  
    Will span two lines

    ```

* Include a backslash at the end of the first line.

    Example

    ```
    This is example\  
    Will span two lines

    ```
* Include an HTML single line break tag at the end of the first line.

    Example

    ```
    This is example<br>  
    Will span two lines

    ```

> If you leave a blank line between `two lines`, both .md files and Markdown in issues, pull requests, and discussions will render the two lines separated by the blank line:

```
This example

Will have a blank line separating both lines

```

### Paragraphs
You can create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between lines of text.

Example:

Para 1: This is paragraph one

Para 2: Thisis paragraph two

Markdown code:

```
Para 1: This is paragraph one

Para 2: Thisis paragraph two
```


### Heading 

If you want to create a heading you use `#` sign

> Note: `H6` is the smallest heading you can have.

Example:

# H1 Heading
## H2 Heading
### H3 Heading
#### H4 Heading
##### H5 Heading
###### H6 Heading

Markdown Code:

```
# H1 Heading
## H2 Heading
### H3 Heading
#### H4 Heading
##### H5 Heading
###### H6 Heading
```

### Text Formating

Example:

**Bold**
<br>
*Italic* or __Italic__
<br>
~~Strikethrough~~ or ~Strikethrough~
<br>
***All bold and italic***
<br>
A<sub>Subscript<sub>
<br>
A<sup>Superscript<sup>
<br>
<ins>underline<ins>

Markdown code:

```
**Bold**
*Italic* or __Italic__
~~Strikethrough~~ or ~Strikethrough~
***All bold and italic***
<sub>Subscript<sub>
<sup>Superscript<sup>
<ins>underline<ins>

```

### Quoting text

You can quote text with a `>`

Example

> Text that is quote

Markdown code:

```
> Text that is quote
```

### Quoting code

Intext code quoting

Example:

Use of `git status` to list all new or modified files that haveen't been committed.

Markdown code:

```
Use of `git status` to list all new or modified files that haveen't been committed.

```

To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks 



Some basic Git commands are:

```
git status
git add
git commit
```


### Supported color models

> Note: The visualization of the color is only supported in issues, pull requests, and discussions.

Example:

HEX: `#ffffff` - #ffffff - white
<br>
RGB: `rgb(R,G,B)` - rgb(R,G,B) - blue
<br>
HSL: `hsl(H,S,L)` - hsl(H,S,L) - blue

Markdown code:

```
HEX: `#ffffff` - #ffffff - white
RGB: `rgb(R,G,B)` - rgb(R,G,B) - blue
HSL: `hsl(H,S,L)` - hsl(H,S,L) - blue

```

### Links

You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets `[ ]`, and then wrapping the URL in parentheses `( )`.

Example:

This is my linkedIn page [Joseph Muganga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-muganga544/).

Markdown code:
```
This is my linkedIn page [Joseph Muganga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-muganga544/).


```

### Section Links


If you need to determine the anchor for a heading in a file you are editing, you can use the following basic rules:

* Letters are converted to lower-case.

* Spaces are replaced by hyphens (-). Any other whitespace or punctuation characters are removed.

* Leading and trailing whitespace are removed.

* Markup formatting is removed, leaving only the contents (for example, _italics_ becomes italics).

* If the automatically generated anchor for a heading is identical to an earlier anchor in the same document, a unique identifier is generated by appending a hyphen and an auto-incrementing integer.


Example:

Link to the Heading section: [Heading Markdown](#heading)

Link to the Quoting code section: [Quoting code Markdown](#quoting-code)

Markdown code:

```
Link to the Heading section: [Heading Markdown](#heading)

Link to the Quoting code section: [Quoting code Markdown](#quoting-code)

```

> If you edit a heading, or if you change the order of headings with "identical" anchors, you will also need to update any links to those headings as the anchors will change.

### Relative Links

A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file.  

For example, if you have a README file in root of your repository, and you have another file in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`, the relative link to `CONTRIBUTING.md` in your README might look like this:

```
[Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

```

Links starting with `/` will be relative to the repository root. You can use all relative link operands, such as `./` and `../.`

> Relative links are easier for users who clone your repository. Absolute links may not work in clones of your repository - we recommend using relative links to refer to other files within your repository.

### Custom anchors

You can use standard HTML anchor tags (<a name="unique-anchor-name"></a>) to create navigation anchor points for any location in the document. 

To avoid ambiguous references, use a unique naming scheme for anchor tags [see](#section-links), such as adding a prefix to the name attribute value.


For example

Some body text o this section

<a name="my-custom-anchor-point"></a>
Some text I want to provide a direct link to, but which doesn't have its own heading.

(... more content...)

[A link to that custom anchor](#my-custom-anchor-point)

Markdown code:
```

Some body text o this section

<a name="my-custom-anchor-point"></a>
Some text I want to provide a direct link to, but which doesn't have its own heading.

(... more content...)

[A link to that custom anchor](#my-custom-anchor-point)

```

### Line breaks

To create a line break in an `.md` file, you will need to include one of the following:

* Include two spaces at the end of the first line.

    Example

    ```
    This is example  
    Will span two lines

    ```

* Include a backslash at the end of the first line.

    Example

    ```
    This is example\  
    Will span two lines

    ```
* Include an HTML single line break tag at the end of the first line.

    Example

    ```
    This is example<br>  
    Will span two lines

    ```

> If you leave a blank line between `two lines`, both .md files and Markdown in issues, pull requests, and discussions will render the two lines separated by the blank line:

```
This example

Will have a blank line separating both lines

```

### Images
You can display an image by adding `!` and wrapping the alt text in `[ ]`. Alt text is a short text equivalent of the information in the image. Then, wrap the link for the image in parentheses `()`.

For example

![Project structure](/assets/images/project_structure.png)

Markdown code:

```
![Project structure](/assets/images/project_structure.png)

```
### Lists

You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with `-`, `*`, or `+`.

```
- Joseph Muganga
* Mungi Buhkay
+ Sande Londezya

```

To order your list, precede each line with a number.

```
1 Joseph Muganga
2 Mungi Buhkay
3 Sande Londezya

```

### Nested Lists

You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.

Example:  
1. First list item
    - First nested list item
        - Second nested list item


Markdown code:  
```
1. First list item
    - First nested list item
        - Second nested list item

```

### Task List
To create a task list, preface list items with a hyphen and space followed by `[ ]`. To mark a task as complete, use `[x]`.

Example:
- [x] #739
- [ ] https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/issues/740
- [ ] Add delight to the experience when all tasks are complete :tada:

Markdown code:

```
- [x] #739
- [ ] https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/issues/740
- [ ] Add delight to the experience when all tasks are complete :tada:

```
> Note: If a task list item description begins with a parenthesis, you'll need to escape it with \:

`- [ ] \(Optional) Open a followup issue`


### Mentioning people and teams

You can mention a person or team on GitHub by typing `@` plus their username or team name.

```
@github/support What do you think about these updates?
```

### Referencing issues and pull requests
You can bring up a list of suggested issues and pull requests within the repository by typing `#`.


### Using emojis

You can add emoji to your writing by typing `:EMOJICODE:`, a colon followed by the name of the emoji.

Example:

Happy to connect :+1:

Markdown code:
```
Happy to connect :+1:
```

More Emojicodes: [EMOJICODE](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/github-actions-auto-update/README.md)


### Footnotes

You can add footnotes to your content by using this bracket syntax:

For example

Here is a simple footnote[^1]

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2]

[^1]: My reference  
[^2]: To add line breaks within a footnote, prefix new lines with 2 spaces.  
  This is a second line


### Alerts

Alerts are a Markdown extension based on the blockquote syntax that you can use to emphasize critical information.

On GitHub, they are displayed with distinctive colors and icons to indicate the significance of the content.



## Summary

In this section we have learned how to set up environment to be able to execute javascript code.We have learned how to use basic command on a terminal to be able to access different files and directories.


For example:

>[!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

>[!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

>[!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

>[!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.

Markdown code:

```

```

### Hiding content with comments

You can tell GitHub to hide content from the rendered Markdown by placing the content in an HTML comment.


```
<!-- This content will not appear in the rendered Markdown-->
```

### Ignoring Markdown formatting

You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character.

For example:

Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.

Markdown code:

```
Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.
```

>[!TIP]
> NOTE: When viewing a Markdown file, you can click Code at the top of the file to disable Markdown rendering and view the file's source instead.
